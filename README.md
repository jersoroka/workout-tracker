## Who is the application for?

The application is designed for weightlifters that want to systematically track their progress. By consistently logging their workouts, the user will be able to track their progress and have data that they can be use to reflect on their own progress and fitness goals.


## Motivation

I enjoy exercising and I've read many times of the advantages of tracking you workout, especially when it comes to identifying weak points, overtraining, and undertraining different parts of the body. I want to make a project that aligns with my interests and is something useful.
